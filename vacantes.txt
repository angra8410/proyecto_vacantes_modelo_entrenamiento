What You'll Do

As a Business Analyst, you will work closely with business leaders to support data-driven decision-making. You'll help make sense of complex data, ensuring accuracy and consistency in how information is connected and interpreted. The ideal candidate understands SQL databases, table structures, and data relationships, and can translate business needs into clear, actionable insights. While SQL and Power BI are integral to the role, the primary focus is on database fluency, analysis, and problem-solving. Your responsibilities include, but are not limited to:


Conduct ad hoc analyses of data sets (e.g., pricing, operational performance, customer trends) and provide actionable recommendations.
Develop a strong understanding of how data interacts across multiple tables and systems to ensure integrity and consistency.
Collaborate with stakeholders to translate business needs into reliable data models, reports, and insights.
Use Excel extensively (advanced formulas, pivots, lookups) to support reporting and analysis.
As a secondary responsibility, write, optimize, and maintain SQL queries to extract and structure data as needed.
Build and maintain Power BI dashboards to visualize and share insights (secondary to SQL/database knowledge).


What You Should Have

Minimum of 3 years of experience as a Business Analyst or in a similar analytical role.
At least 1 year of remote work experience, preferably with companies based in the US, UK, Canada, or Australia.
Strong knowledge of SQL databases, table structures, joins, and data relationships.
Proven experience analyzing large, multi-source datasets (e.g., pricing, operations, customer data) and translating findings into actionable insights.
Familiarity with SQL query writing and Power BI (or similar BI tools) for reporting and dashboard creation (secondary to SQL/database expertise).
Advanced Excel skills, including complex formulas, pivot tables, lookups, and data modeling.
Experience using collaboration tools such as Teams, Zoho Projects, Notion, Slack, Asana, or similar platforms.
Ability to work independently and manage multiple priorities in a fast-paced environment.
Strong analytical and problem-solving skills, with the ability to simplify complexity and support sound decision-making.
Experience working with pricing, financial, or operational data in a growth-focused business environment.
Excellent written and verbal communication skills in English.
