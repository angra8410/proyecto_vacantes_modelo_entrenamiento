  Founded in 2010, we started RevenueWell because we saw a way to use the latest marketing automation technology to help dentists build better, more connected relationships with their patients and communities. We think it’s a problem worth solving, and thousands of dental practices across the country seem to agree. The company has grown very quickly over the last few years, and we’re now a team of about 200 diverse people that are committed to our mission, super-focused on our product, and fanatical about helping our customers succeed.
  In December 2019, we partnered with Marlin Equity Partners to help us aggressively expand our vision in healthcare. Since then, we have more than doubled our footprint (through strong organic growth and acquisition of PBHS) to over 12,000 customers, and we are just getting started! If you are excited about healthcare, working with talented people, aren’t afraid to roll up your sleeves, and want to help build a healthcare technology company that makes a real difference for providers and patients – this opportunity might just be for you.
