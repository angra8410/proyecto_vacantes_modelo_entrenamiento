This role requires a passion for hyperautomation and a mentality of starting with the client in mind first. The growth potential and opportunities here are endless and we want you to be a part of our journey. Curious what your day would look like as a Business Analyst? Check out the details below!
  
  Key Responsibilities
  
  Keep internal teams up to date on the current process being developed, as well as prevent any blockers - internal or external - are resolved to allow process development to continue.
  Keep documentation up to date for a project through its entire SDLC by gathering requirements and translating them to user stories on Jira and Test Plans on Confluence.
  Experience in quality assurance/testing of process's as well as creating test plans/test cases with related bug tickets where applicable.
  Manage scope creep alongside time for a project to maximize profitability and resource use; evaluate risks to project timelines and communicate to the appropriate team members.
  Lead communications between internal and external teams; act as a translator between client and internal technical teams, to offer a clear understanding from all involved parties.
  Support internal and external teams during the SDLC with effective documentation and notes; ensure the project goes smoothly and escalate as required to guarantee this. Make sure every stage is documented as per the documentation needs.
  Understand the clients needs and offer optimal resolution paths whilst working with Senior level developers.
  Assist with project management tasks to work cohesively as a team to ensure smooth client delivery.
  
  Requirements
  
  3-5 years experience.
  Technical background is a must - have knowledge of code/software development and its general functionalities (Not the ability to code but a bonus!)
  Ability to read code logically is a big bonus.
  Experience in an Agile and fast paced environment.
  Excellent oral and written communication skills.
  We don't micromanage and we trust our team to get the job done - so you must be able to work autonomously whilst reporting updates to your PM/Lead as needed.
  Great relationship management skills - you'll be working with multiple clients and internal teams all the time so you'll need to be able to work with a lot of different personalities and people from different cultures.
  Organizational skills - project management, story management, scope management and most importantly TIME management!
  Requirements gathering and translating into proper user stories (As a, I want, so that).
  Experience with RPA technologies is preferred, but we can make it work if you have insight into what the technology is and can do.
  Ability to differentiate between the wants and needs of clients.
  Have thick skin - you're going to get constructive criticism internally and externally - be willing to grow!
